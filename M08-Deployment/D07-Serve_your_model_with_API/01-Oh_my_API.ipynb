    "\n",
    "We use this term extensively, but do you understand what is an API? It is the acronym for _Application Programming Interface_. Not much, huh? In this module, we are going to discover and implement our own API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why. Because we have plenty of cool solutions out there, like MLFlow üòâ, to serve our model and even more. Why would you bother with this _thing_? Because it is important for you to understand what _is_ actually an API: how it works, how you can request one and, above all, how to create your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "API is not only useful to serve your model, it is a way to share data across servers. Sooner or later, you will face one of these beasts and it is better to be prepared. Right?\n",

    "\n",
    "APIs are interfaces. For example each time you are interacting with a library in Python you are using its API. An API is the exposed ‚Äì¬†or public ‚Äì part of an application. What is behind this interface is none your concerns. You just call something, with some parameters, and get something back in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "We broadly use API in the sense of interfaces with web applications. It is a set of URLs that return data responses when requested. Most of the time, the data responses fit a format like <a href=\"https://www.json.org/json-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">JSON</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\" target=\"_blank\">XML</a> so you can parse responses easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main difference between API and websites: when your browser requests a website's page to a server, the server returns data in HTML format. This format embeds everything the browser should know to display the page, whereas APIs will return those formatted datas in JSON ‚Äì¬†mostly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some APIs are public, others are private. It is up to you to build one API that fits your requirements: what kind of data do you want to share, how, with who, and so on. Pretty much everything is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most APIs rely on HTTP protocol to communicate. Several standards exists in order to unify the way we use APIs. One of the most popular standards is the  <a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm\" target=\"_blank\">REST standard</a> for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember those <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.1\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP methods</a>: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE? We use them to build requests. Each of them illustrates a type of action: \n",
    "\n",
    "- GET retrieves resources,\n",
    "- POST submits new data to the server,\n",
    "- PUT updates existing data,\n",
    "- DELETE removes data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods map to the CRUD, _Create Read Update Delete_, operations. Almost every API respects this pattern."

    "First of all, most API have documentation to start with. API documentations are essential because they list all _endpoints_ you can request, and their parameters.

    ">* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.\n",
    ">* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. \n",
    ">* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. \n",
    ">* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.\n",
    ">* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.\n",
    ">* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.\n",
    ">* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.\n",
    ">* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.\n",
