    "\n",
    "To fully understand how backend programming works, it is important to understand how communications over the Internet work.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is the most widely used protocol since the 1990s to transfer data over the Internet. Exchanges are made between a **server** and a **web browser** (chrome, firefox, internet explorer etc.) running on a machine known as the **client**.  \n",

    "* Clients performs an **HTTP** **request** via a Browser\n",
    "* Server processes the request and sends an **HTTP** **response**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of request/response is fundamental because it will determine how you write code. So just imagine your web browser as an interface that allows you to create requests to a server that stores data, which will respond according to these requests."
